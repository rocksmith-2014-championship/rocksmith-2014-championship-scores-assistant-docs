## States Description

#### SCRAPED

* Initial state set by the [Scraper](scraper.md)
* It means that the image of the score was fetched from the forum and inserted into the database.

#### RECOGNIZED

* It means that the image has been recognized as a proper image score by the [Detector](detector.md)
* It's an internal state, because the [Detector](detector.md) will then proceed to classify it, so it's never visible on the app

#### NOT_RECOGNIZED

* it means that something went wrong with the detection
* it can be a valid score not properly recognized o not a score

#### DOWNLOAD_FAILED

#### INVALID_SCORE

* can be applied by the user from the frontend if a score does not meet the requirements
* it can be a final state, but it can be also edited and corrected from the user interface

#### ERROR

* something went wrong and unexpected. See the notes

#### CLASSIFIED

* all the data is there and artist and song has been recognized between those from the week (by the [Detector](detector.md))

#### CLASSIFICATION_FAILED

* detected song doesn't match any of the songs of the week (by the [Detector](detector.md))

#### AUTO_APPROVED

* once a a score it's [classified](#classified), the [Detector](detector.md) automatically approves it

#### MANUALLY_APPROVED

#### EDITING

#### PUSHED

* final state if everything went well for this score
* it means that this score has been recorded into the week scores gsheet
* it's applied automatically from the google apps script
* it can't be applied from the [user interface](validator.md)
